## Application Description

The "Knight's Random Walk" Problem is a very interesting problem that seems dauntingly difficult to solve at first, but with the use of Markov Chain Theory and Graphs in C++, not only is the problem easily solved with a mathematically proven solution, but is also relatively easy to simulate.
